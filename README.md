# PowerCycle ðŸš²

Cycles through files in a directory. The files are globbed using a regex that can be configured.

Used https://github.com/karsonbraaten/cycle as a starting point (though little of the original code remains).

## Features

Keyboard shortcut to quickly switch between files in a directory (like logic/template/style files
for a UI component).

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `powercycle.regex`: the regular expression used to glob files in the current file's directory, defaults to `*`

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of PowerCycle.
